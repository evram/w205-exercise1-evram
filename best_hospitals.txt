The best way to rank the hospitals would be:
1. for each procedure type calculate the mean and the SD.
2. Using the mean and the the SD, calcualte the z score for each specific procerdure done
3. For each hospital, Average out the z scores for all procedures done in that hospital.

This methodolgy would normalize the data so that hospitals aren't penalizedfor executing procedures which are typically lower scored.

Since I do not have th tools to execure this algorithm, I instead used a simple average
