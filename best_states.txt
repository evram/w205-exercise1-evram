The best way to rank the states would be:
1. for each procedure type calculate the mean and the SD.
2. Using the mean and the the SD, calcualte the z score for each specific procerdure done
3. For each state Average out the z scores for all procedures done in that state

This methodolgy would normalize the data so that statesaren't penalized for executing procedures which are typically lower scored (and vice versa)

Since I feel that I do not have the tools to execure this algorithm, I instead used an average
